# Sherpa-UI 
## A ReactVR Website Builder

Sherpa-UI allows you to rapidly create engaging experiences in VR that emulate traditional web-browsing.  

Built with React.JS and Electron, SherpaUI is for developers and non-developers alike.

ReactVR provides a 3D 'sphere' in which a camera is placed at the very center, and allows for a 360° x 360° field of view.  Shepra-UI streamlines development in this environment by splitting the spehre into four equal sections.  Text that you enter in the input fields on the right will show up in the VR image after clicking 'Update'.
